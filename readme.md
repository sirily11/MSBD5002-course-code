# MSBD5002 Data mining

Algorithm in class implemented in python. The algorithms' implementations are not strictly follow the correct input. It follows the representations in class.

## List of algorithms
(could work with example in class)
- Apriori
- K-means
- Fp growth
- Draw FP tree
- Polythetic approach
- decision tree
    - card
    - c45
    - id3
